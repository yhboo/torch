DRAVO LAST MONTH AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO SELL ITS INLAND WATER TRANSPORTATION STEVEDORING AND PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESSES FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
THE COMBINED BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF DRAVO'S EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE REVENUE
IN SEPTEMBER THE COMPANY RECEIVED NINETY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AS ITS SHARE OF DAMAGES FROM A BREACH OF CONTRACT AWARD RELATED TO A COAL PARTNERSHIP
SOUTH AFRICA THE SOLUTION BY FRANCES KENDALL AND LEON LOUW HAS SOLD OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COPIES SINCE LAST YEAR
AS MS. KENDALL AND MR. LOUW SEE IT SOUTH AFRICA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS LIKE A BIG LUMBERING TANK
WHITE BUREAUCRATS ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND BLACKS RIGHTLY FEAR WHAT THE TANK'S WEAPONS CAN DO TO THEM
MANY WANT TO STORM THE TANK AND TAKE IT OVER
BUT IF THE HISTORY OF OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS IS ANY GUIDE WHITES INDIANS AND SMALL BLACK TRIBES SHOULD FEAR THAT
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS MOST CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES PRICES WERE STRONGER
WHEAT FUTURES WERE SUPPORTED BY CONCERN THAT WHEAT MAY BE VULNERABLE IF COLD SNAPS FOLLOW THIS PAST WEEKEND'S WARMTH ANALYSTS SAID
THE WARMING TREND MAY HAVE MELTED THE SNOW COVER ON SOME CROPS
CORN FUTURES RECEIVED SOME STRENGTH ON EXPECTATION THAT THE AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT WOULD RAISE SOVIET IMPORT FORECASTS ANALYSTS SAID
AFTER THE CLOSE OF TRADING THE FORECASTS WERE INCREASED
SOYBEAN FUTURES PRICES WERE MIXED WITH BEANS AND OIL FINISHING HIGHER
STRONGER PALM OIL PRICES HELPED OIL PRICES FIRM ANALYSTS SAID
CONTACTS STILL INSIDE OWENS CORNING HELP TOO
MR. COLLINS LEARNED THAT AN OWENS CORNING DIVISION WAS REDUCING ITS STAFF AND WOULD NEED OUTSIDE HELP TO PRODUCE A NEWSLETTER
HE MADE A SALES CALL HE SAYS
IT WASN'T A GIVEAWAY
I SAT DOWN AND FIGURED OUT WHAT THEY NEEDED AND SOLD THEM ON IT
THE SENSE OF IMPENDING DOOM HAS STYMIED TEAMWORK THEY SAY
THERE WAS A LOT MORE HELPING OUT AND SHARING BEFORE SAYS BILL K. THE CREDIT MANAGER
TODAY HE SAYS THE ATTITUDE IS I'VE GOT MY JOB AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR JOB
ADDS JIM A DIVISION MANAGER FOR A RETAILER IT'S A DOG EAT DOG WORLD
MR. HOLMES A COURT SAID HE PLANS TO REVIEW THE STRUCTURE OF BELL GROUP
IT MAY BE THAT OUR STRUCTURE AND MULTIPLICITY OF CORPORATIONS ISN'T THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE FUTURE
NO FIRM PLAN HAS BEEN DEVISED BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO REVIEW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE HE SAID
THE PEOPLE'S PARTY CADRE MOVED INTO KEY POSITIONS IN AREAS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION LABOR FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AGRICULTURE
THIS ALLOWED IT TO PLACE MORE OF ITS CADRE IN THE PANAMANIAN BUREAUCRACY
NUMEROUS COMRADES WERE APPOINTED MOST OF WHOM GRADUATED FROM UNIVERSITIES IN COMMUNIST BLOC NATIONS
AS WITH THE REST OF THE REGIME HOWEVER THEIR IDEOLOGY BECAME CONTAMINATED BY THE GERM OF CORRUPTION
THIS WAS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE POLITICAL LABOR AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS WHICH UNCONDITIONALLY SURRENDERED TO THE DEFENSE FORCES
THE SAGA BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN PENNZOIL SUED TEXACO OVER ITS ACQUISITION OF GETTY OIL
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE PENNZOIL WON NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES AT TRIAL THE BIGGEST JUDGMENT EVER AWARDED A PLAINTIFF
THE TWO COMPANIES AGREED TO SETTLE THE CASE FOR THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LATE DECEMBER
PENNZOIL HAS BEEN FRETTING OVER THE DETAILS OF MOVING THE MONEY EVER SINCE
SUMMITS HAVE THEIR POLITICAL BENEFITS OF COURSE NOT LEAST THAT THE PRESIDENT DOMINATES THE NEWS
VICE PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANGE OF SUBJECT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THE DRUMBEAT ABOUT PANAMA AND GENERAL NORIEGA
BUT HAVING TALKED TO A VARIETY OF REPUBLICANS ABOUT THIS IN RECENT WEEKS I'M CONVINCED THAT MORE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS PARADOX OF DETENTE THAN PUBLICLY LET ON
THERE'S NO DOUBT WE'VE DIMINISHED THE SOVIET THREAT VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LAST YEAR SAYS MINNESOTA REPRESENTATIVE VIN WEBER
BUT THERE ARE ALSO RISKS
TOO STEEP A FALL CAN MEAN HIGHER INFLATION AND EVENTUALLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES
A LOWER DOLLAR ALSO MAKES IT CHEAPER FOR FOREIGNERS TO BUY U. S. ASSETS EVERYTHING FROM STOCKS AND BONDS TO REAL ESTATE AND CORPORATIONS
MR. AZIZ A FORMER ENGLISH TEACHER IS ADEPT AT DELIVERING STRAIGHT TALK WITH DIPLOMATIC SMILES THAT SOFTEN THE HARSHNESS OF HIS WORDS
BUT EVEN THIS SILVER HAIRED CIGAR SMOKING DIPLOMAT USED TOUGH WORDS TO DESCRIBE AMERICA'S ARMS SALES TO IRAN
MR. AZIZ WHO WAS IRAQ'S LINK TO THE U. S. IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE ABOUT THE AMERICAN DECEPTION OVER IRAN
WE FELT THIS WAS AN ACT OF AGGRESSION HE SAID WITHOUT ANY MORAL OR POLITICAL JUSTIFICATION
HE SAID THE SALES HAD HAD A MAJOR PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON IRAN AND A NEGATIVE MILITARY IMPACT ON IRAQ
ASSOCIATED INNS KNOWN AS AIRCOA IS THE GENERAL PARTNER OF AIRCOA HOTEL PARTNERS AND HAS A ONE PERCENT GENERAL PARTNER INTEREST IN THE PARTNERSHIP
THE REMAINING NINETY NINE PERCENT INTEREST IN THE PARTNERSHIP CURRENTLY IS HELD BY AFFILIATES OF AIRCOA
AN AIRCOA SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY FORMED THE VENTURE TO CREATE A FINANCING VEHICLE FOR FUTURE HOTEL PROJECTS
EARLY LAST WEEK MR. CHUN DID OFFER CONCESSIONS
HE SAID HE WOULD REOPEN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION WHICH IN APRIL HE HAD SUSPENDED UNTIL AFTER THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OLYMPICS
THE OPPOSITION REJECTED THE GESTURE AS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE
GLASNOST HAS ALSO BEEN GOOD TO LAWRENCE LEIGHTON SMITH
LAST YEAR HE WENT TO THE SOVIET UNION TO RECORD WITH THE MOSCOW PHILHARMONIC THE FIRST TIME AN AMERICAN CONDUCTOR HAS DONE SO
HE SAYS IT CAN GET CORNY TO SAY THAT MUSIC IS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE BUT IT REALLY IS
MUSICIANS ARE MUSICIANS
YESTERDAY'S SESSION BEGAN WITH A SHARP QUICK DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE OF MORE THAN FORTY FIVE POINTS WHICH SOME MARKET ANALYSTS ATTRIBUTED TO FOREIGN SELLING
BUT TO THE SURPRISE OF ALMOST EVERYONE STOCK PRICES BEGAN A STEADY CLIMB THAT PUSHED THE AVERAGE ABOVE WEDNESDAY'S CLOSE
ALTHOUGH THOSE GAINS ERODED DURING THE AFTERNOON STOCK PRICES STAYED WITHIN A NARROW RANGE UNTIL THE LAST HALF HOUR OF TRADING
WHATEVER THE CASE THE MAIN FOCUS OF ATTENTION REMAINS TODAY'S TRADE REPORT
THIS MARKET IS WAITING FOR ONLY ONE THING SAID ALFRED ROTH A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT THOMSON MCKINNON SECURITIES INCORPORATED
THE BIG SHOE IS GOING TO DROP WHEN WE SEE THE TRADE NUMBER
BIDS TOTALING SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SIX POINT THREE EIGHT FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT FOUR THREE SIX PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE FOR NEXT TUESDAY
HE NOTED THAT LAST WEEK'S ONE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT DROP IN THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE RESULTED FROM A SLIGHTLY WEAKER DOLLAR
THE MARKETS TEND TO MAGNIFY THE NEWS
THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE REACTED SO BADLY LAST WEEK AND PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE REACTED SO WELL TO THIS
ASTRONOMERS SAY THAT THE EARTH'S FATE IS SEALED
FIVE BILLION YEARS FROM NOW THE SUN WILL SLOWLY SWALLOW THE EARTH IN A HUGE FIREBALL
THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE IS STILL A MYSTERY
ASTRONOMERS CAN'T TELL WHETHER THE UNIVERSE WILL EXPAND FOREVER POWERED BY THE BIG BANG OF OLD OR WHETHER IT WILL SOMEDAY COLLAPSE INTO AN APOCALYPTIC BIG CRUNCH
LA GUARDIA HAS ONLY FIFTY SEVEN GATES BUT AT PEAK HOURS DOZENS OF MORE PLANES MAY BE ON THE GROUND
WHEN FLIGHTS ARRIVE EARLY PILOTS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PARK THE JET AND WAIT FOR A GATE
THE GATES AND CORRIDORS WERE DESIGNED FOR SMALLER AIRCRAFT
WIDE BODIED AIRCRAFT TAKE UP TWO GATES FURTHER SNARLING TRAFFIC
NOW WHATEVER THEIR DRAWBACKS IN REAL LIFE WIMPS IN FICTION ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD THINGS
THEY CAN BE HILARIOUSLY FUNNY AS WELL AS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR SATIRE
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE WORK OF BRITISH NOVELISTS AND EVEN PREVIOUSLY IN THE WORK OF WILLIAM BOYD
N. A. S. A. SCHEDULED THE LAUNCH OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY FOR SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH
THE SHUTTLE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO LIFT OFF SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CHALLENGER EXPLOSION
THE LAUNCH HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT WAS SCRUBBED BY THE SPACE AGENCY ABOUT FIVE TIMES BECAUSE OF DESIGN AND OTHER DELAYS
HONDURAS SAID A D. C. THREE TRANSPORT SHOT DOWN MONDAY BY HONDURAN FIGHTERS APPARENTLY WAS CARRYING DRUGS FROM COLOMBIA
THE PILOT AN AMERICAN AND TWO OTHERS ABOARD DIED IN THE CRASH
OFFICIALS IN TEGUCIGALPA SAID THE PLANE IGNORED REQUESTS TO LAND AFTER ENTERING HONDURAN AIRSPACE
DURING THE HONOLULU FEDERAL NEGOTIATIONS MR. SIMON RAN INTO MR. MARTIN AT THE CHRISTENING OF A MUTUAL FRIEND'S CHILD
THE TWO MEN HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR SOME YEARS BUT THEIR MEETING TURNED OUT TO BE PROPITIOUS
MR. MARTIN RECENTLY DEPARTED FROM THE FED TOLD MR. SIMON DURING A RIDE TO WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT THAT HE MIGHT START A PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE CONCERN
INSTEAD MR. SIMON PERSUADED HIM TO JOIN HIS GROUP AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE VARIOUS HOLDING COMPANIES TO BE SET UP TO OWN EACH THRIFT
STORIES OF THE LEFT WING ANTICS OF BRITAIN'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE APPEARED IN THE BRITISH PRESS FOR SEVERAL YEARS
IN RECENT WEEKS FOR EXAMPLE READERS HERE HAVE HEARD OF THE BANNING OF ANTI IRISH JOKES IN ONE LONDON BOROUGH
THEY'VE LEARNED OF A BOOK DISTRIBUTED IN ANOTHER BOROUGH CALLED JESSE'S DREAM SKIRT ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO CHALLENGES SEXISM BY DRESSING AS A GIRL
THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAS GOTTEN USED TO ENJOYING SUCH LOONY LEFT STORIES AS PART OF ITS REGULAR NEWSPAPER DIET
BUT THERE'S AN UGLY SIDE TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT DESERVES CLOSER ATTENTION
U. S. EXPORTS ROSE IN THE MONTH BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS IMPORTS
STRONG IMPORTS HOWEVER MEAN THAT DOMESTIC DEMAND RIGHT NOW IS STRONG ONE SURE WAY TO CURB A TRADE DEFICIT IS TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN RECESSION
TRADE DEFICITS WEAKEN THE DOLLAR AS THEY DID LAST WEEK AND IN THE SHORT RUN A WEAKER DOLLAR MEANS MORE HELP FOR EXPORTS
IN THE LONGER RUN THE WEAK DOLLAR MAY MEAN MORE INFLATION AND TIGHT MONEY AND EVENTUALLY A RECESSION
RIGHT NOW HOWEVER THE ECONOMY APPEARS STILL TO BE GROWING
FOR MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY'D EVER SEEN AN AMERICAN INVESTOR SAYS MR. ARON
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT COMMODORE MATTHEW C.
PERRY DISCOVERED JAPAN FOR AMERICANS ACTUALLY IT WAS PAUL ARON HE QUIPS
MR. HOLMES A COURT SAID HE PLANS TO REVIEW THE STRUCTURE OF BELL GROUP
IT MAY BE THAT OUR STRUCTURE AND MULTIPLICITY OF CORPORATIONS ISN'T THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE FUTURE
NO FIRM PLAN HAS BEEN DEVISED BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO REVIEW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE HE SAID
MR. ROBERTSON CAN BEST BE UNDERSTOOD NOT AS A NEW FIGURE IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT BUT AS THE HEIR OF THE POPULISTS AND FATHER COUGHLIN
AS THE POPULISTS DID HE APPEALS TO LESS EDUCATED LOWER MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE WHO FIND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGE FRIGHTENING
POPULIST MEETINGS HAD A REVIVALIST FLAVOR WITH BANNERS URGING PEOPLE TO VOTE AS THEY PRAYED
BUT THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAILER CHICAGO BASED SEARS ROEBUCK AND COMPANY REPORTED A DECLINE OF ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES
THE COMPANY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE RESULTS
PAINEWEBBER'S MS. MCGLADE SAID A SPECIAL PROMOTION BOOSTED YEAR EARLIER SALES SIGNIFICANTLY MAKING IT HARD TO ACHIEVE GAINS IN THE LATEST PERIOD
GEORGE E. R. KINNEAR THE SECOND WAS NAMED TO THE NEW POST OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF LONG RANGE PLANNING AND RELATED GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
HE HAD BEEN SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF WASHINGTON OPERATIONS FOR THE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR
PETER F. BARRY SUCCEEDS MR. KINNEAR IN WASHINGTON AS A VICE PRESIDENT
MR. BARRY HAD BEEN PRESIDENT OF HARTMAN SYSTEMS A UNIT OF FIGGIE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
NOW CIBA IS TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS
IT INVITED RESIDENTS TO JOIN A COMMITTEE TO AIR THEIR GRIPES AGAINST THE COMPANY AND DISCUSS SOLUTIONS
THE COMPANY ALSO DONATED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP TO HIRE SPECIALISTS TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED SITES
THE CONSULTANTS NOTICED AN OMISSION IN THE PLANS THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR FEDERAL REGULATORS HAD SPOTTED
CIBA AGREED TO REMEDY THE OVERSIGHT
N. A. S. A. SCHEDULED THE LAUNCH OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY FOR SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH
THE SHUTTLE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO LIFT OFF SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CHALLENGER EXPLOSION
THE LAUNCH HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT WAS SCRUBBED BY THE SPACE AGENCY ABOUT FIVE TIMES BECAUSE OF DESIGN AND OTHER DELAYS
SEVERAL TIRE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES AND ANALYSTS QUESTION WHETHER A SLIMMED DOWN FIRESTONE CAN PROSPER MERELY BY MAKING TIRES AND REPAIRING CARS
THEY EXPECT COMPANIES TO GROW OR DISAPPEAR
HE HAS PROVEN THAT HE CAN TURN A SICK ANIMAL INTO A HEALTHY ONE SAYS HARRY W. MILLIS TIRE ANALYST WITH MCDONALD AND COMPANY CLEVELAND
HE'S DONE VERY WELL FOR STOCKHOLDERS
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE COMPANY GOES FROM HERE
THE AUDIO AND AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRIES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE LET EARLY ADVANTAGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR DESIGN SLIP AWAY
BRITISH APPLIANCE MAKERS HAVE LOST GROUND TO CONTINENTAL EUROPEANS WHO HAVE ESTABLISHED A REPUTATION FOR DESIGN AND QUALITY STANDARDS
TELEVISION SET MAKERS REGULARLY SCHEDULED T. V. PROGRAMMING BEGAN HERE HAVE LOST OUT TO THE JAPANESE AND THE EUROPEANS
BRITISH COMPUTER BRANDS LIKE SINCLAIR AND ACORN HAVE BLOOMED BUT QUICKLY FADED
E. E. C. O. INCORPORATED ISN'T SELLING EX DIVIDEND TODAY
IT WILL SELL EX DIVIDEND AT A LATER DATE
THE ERROR WAS BY THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE
FOR MONTHS HE HAD SUFFERED NIGHT SWEATS FEVERS AND WEIGHT LOSS
SO FINALLY THE WORRIED NEW YORKER HAD HIS BLOOD TESTED FOR EVIDENCE OF THE AIDS VIRUS
THE RESULT WAS POSITIVE
HE AND OTHER U. S. INDUSTRY LEADERS INSIST THOUGH THAT IMPORTS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME DEGREE OF SCRUTINY
AND THEY BALK AT THE APPROACH USED IN MEAT AND POULTRY PLANTS CONTINUOUS INSPECTION OF PRODUCTION LINES
INSTEAD THEY FAVOR UNANNOUNCED CHECKS BY ROVING RATHER THAN IN HOUSE INSPECTORS FOCUSING ON CRITICAL CONTROL POINTS IN SEAFOOD PROCESSING
ASTRONOMERS SAY THAT THE EARTH'S FATE IS SEALED
FIVE BILLION YEARS FROM NOW THE SUN WILL SLOWLY SWALLOW THE EARTH IN A HUGE FIREBALL
THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE IS STILL A MYSTERY
ASTRONOMERS CAN'T TELL WHETHER THE UNIVERSE WILL EXPAND FOREVER POWERED BY THE BIG BANG OF OLD OR WHETHER IT WILL SOMEDAY COLLAPSE INTO AN APOCALYPTIC BIG CRUNCH
PROMPTED BY NEWS REPORTS OF ALLEGED MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS THE S. E. C. VISITED THE FIRM'S NEW YORK HEADQUARTERS LAST WEEK WITH THE INTENTION OF EXAMINING BUSINESS RECORDS
INSTEAD IT FOUND THAT A FASHION DESIGN FIRM MIGUEL CRUZ INTERNATIONAL WAS OPERATING AT THE LOCATION REGISTERED AS THAT OF MR. POLO'S INVESTMENT FIRM
MR. POLO ALSO OWNS THE FASHION COMPANY
AT FORTY YEARS OLD MR. WANG IS RELATIVELY YOUNG FOR HIS JOB AND THAT UPSETS COLLEAGUES WHO ARE USED TO A GRADUAL PROMOTION SYSTEM BASED ON SENIORITY
SO MR. WANG TELLS PEOPLE HE IS FIFTY
HIS M. B. A. ALSO IRKS SOME COLLEAGUES WHO ARE CONTEMPTUOUS OF FOREIGN CONCEPTS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAKE THEM WORK HARDER
STERLING SOFTWARE WHICH SAID IT AGREED TO SELL ITS COMMERCIAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES GROUP FELL ONE EIGHTH TO SEVEN AND ONE EIGHTH
THE COMPANY SAID THE GROUP'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WILL BE SOLD SEPARATELY
IT DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE BUYERS OR DISCLOSE TERMS OF THE SALES
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY HAS BAFFLED SCIENTISTS EVER SINCE G. A. B. DUCHENNE FIRST RECOGNIZED THE DISORDER IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT
SINCE EACH GENE IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR A PROTEIN THE DEFECT IS KNOWN TO INVOLVE A PROTEIN THAT AFFECTS MUSCLES
BUT ATTEMPTS TO ISOLATE A MISSING OR DEFECTIVE PROTEIN IN THE MUSCLE TISSUE OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY PATIENTS HAVE LONG PROVED FRUSTRATING
NOW CIBA IS TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS
IT INVITED RESIDENTS TO JOIN A COMMITTEE TO AIR THEIR GRIPES AGAINST THE COMPANY AND DISCUSS SOLUTIONS
THE COMPANY ALSO DONATED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP TO HIRE SPECIALISTS TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED SITES
THE CONSULTANTS NOTICED AN OMISSION IN THE PLANS THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR FEDERAL REGULATORS HAD SPOTTED
CIBA AGREED TO REMEDY THE OVERSIGHT
A. G. EDWARDS AS IT OFTEN HAS DURING THE PAST YEAR THE SAINT LOUIS FIRM SHOWED UP ITS NINE NEW YORK COMPETITORS IN THE LATEST QUARTER
EDWARDS TENDS TO SELECT THE STOCKS OF RELATIVELY SMALL COMPANIES OFTEN NOT WIDELY FOLLOWED ON WALL STREET THAT MEET TRADITIONAL VALUE CRITERIA
FOR EXAMPLE IT LIKES STOCKS THAT SELL AT A LOW MULTIPLE OF THE COMPANY'S BOOK VALUE OR ASSETS MINUS LIABILITIES PER SHARE
IT ALSO FAVORS STOCKS THAT PAY GOOD DIVIDENDS
THE AVERAGE DIVIDEND YIELD OF ITS RECOMMENDED STOCKS IS THREE POINT SEVEN PERCENT THE SECOND HIGHEST IN THE GROUP AFTER SMITH BARNEY'S FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT
I. B. M. FELL ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND THREE EIGHTHS ON MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES
FURMAN SELZ MAGER DIETZ AND BIRNEY REPORTEDLY JOINED THE CROWD OF WALL STREET HOUSES CUTTING THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN I. B. M. EARNINGS ESTIMATE
THE FIRM SAID IT DOESN'T COMMENT ON ITS STOCK RECOMMENDATIONS OR EARNINGS ESTIMATES
PROBABLY THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE EARNINGS UPTURN FOR MAJOR PRODUCERS IS A NEW PAY STRUCTURE HAMMERED OUT IN THE HEAVILY UNIONIZED PACIFIC NORTHWEST
IN ORDER TO STAY COMPETITIVE WITH A PROLIFERATING NUMBER OF SMALL NONUNION OPERATIONS IN THE REGION MOST COMPANIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SQUEEZED SUBSTANTIAL WAGE CONCESSIONS FROM LUMBER UNIONS
ALTHOUGH SUCH EFFORTS TRIGGERED A RASH OF UNSUCCESSFUL STRIKES LAST SUMMER MANAGEMENT'S ADOPTION OF THE NEW AGGRESSIVE POSTURE HAD TO BE DONE SAYS ONE ANALYST
A LITTLE GOOD NEWS COULD SOFTEN THE MARKET'S RESISTANCE
THAT FICKLE MARKET CHANGES QUICKLY SAYS JOHN EICHORN CHAIRMAN OF EASTERN UTILITIES ASSOCIATES BOSTON WHICH OWNS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF SEABROOK
WE JUST GET A GOOD SIGN AND THAT MARKET WILL RESPOND
U. S. WARSHIPS AND HELICOPTERS CHASED AWAY AN IRANIAN WARSHIP FROM A CONVOY OF FOUR KUWAITI TANKERS IN THE PERSIAN GULF
IT WAS CONSIDERED THE FIRST MAJOR CONFRONTATION IN THE U. S. ESCORT OPERATION
IN A SEPARATE INCIDENT A U. S. DESTROYER FIRED MACHINE GUN WARNING SHOTS AT TWO SMALL UNIDENTIFIED BOATS THAT APPROACHED THE CONVOY
MR. HOLMES A COURT SAID HE PLANS TO REVIEW THE STRUCTURE OF BELL GROUP
IT MAY BE THAT OUR STRUCTURE AND MULTIPLICITY OF CORPORATIONS ISN'T THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE FUTURE
NO FIRM PLAN HAS BEEN DEVISED BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO REVIEW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE HE SAID
WHATEVER THE CASE THE MAIN FOCUS OF ATTENTION REMAINS TODAY'S TRADE REPORT
THIS MARKET IS WAITING FOR ONLY ONE THING SAID ALFRED ROTH A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT THOMSON MCKINNON SECURITIES INCORPORATED
THE BIG SHOE IS GOING TO DROP WHEN WE SEE THE TRADE NUMBER
THE PHILIPPINE MILITARY SAID IT HAD UNCOVERED A PLOT BY COMMUNIST GUERRILLAS TO KILL RETIRED U. S. MAJOR GENERAL SINGLAUB
THE PLAN WAS DISCOVERED AFTER DECODING DATA CAPTURED IN LAST WEEK'S ARREST OF TWENTY REBEL LEADERS
THE REBELS HAVE ACCUSED SINGLAUB OF FORMING ANTI COMMUNIST VIGILANTE GROUPS
EVEN THE EBULLIENCE ON THE FLOOR OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE WAS TEMPERED BY A FEW GLOOMY THOUGHTS
THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME PESSIMISTS AND CYNICS SAID A FLOOR SPECIALIST
THERE ARE SOME GUYS HERE THAT ARE SAYING THIS IS THE FINAL JUMP BEFORE THE CRASH
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE
GEORGE E. R. KINNEAR THE SECOND WAS NAMED TO THE NEW POST OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF LONG RANGE PLANNING AND RELATED GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
HE HAD BEEN SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF WASHINGTON OPERATIONS FOR THE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR
PETER F. BARRY SUCCEEDS MR. KINNEAR IN WASHINGTON AS A VICE PRESIDENT
MR. BARRY HAD BEEN PRESIDENT OF HARTMAN SYSTEMS A UNIT OF FIGGIE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
BUT OTHER OBSERVERS AREN'T SO PESSIMISTIC
ABBY JOSEPH COHEN A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT SAYS THE LESS THAN EBULLIENT REACTION WAS ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH THE NEW MOOD ON WALL STREET
IN GENERAL INVESTORS ARE A CONSERVATIVE LOT THESE DAYS SHE SAYS
RESPONSES TEND TO BE MUTED
WE'RE SEEING A RESPONSE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT'S CLEARLY TEMPERED BY NATURAL CONSERVATISM RIGHT NOW
I'M NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY WITH WHAT I'M SEEING
NOT EVERYONE BUYS THE DEATH OF THE DOLLAR THESIS
WHILE NOT RULING OUT THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY COULD DECLINE OVER TIME MR. LIPSKY OF SALOMON SAYS HE THINKS THE JURY IS STILL OUT
HE ARGUES THAT FRIDAY'S UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES UNDERMINED THE THESIS OF A SHARPLY SLOWING ECONOMY
HE ALSO SAYS THE AUTHORITIES MEAN WHAT THEY SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT STAND ASIDE AND LET CURRENCIES REACH NEW LOWS POST ELECTION
MR. VAGELOS SAID THAT IN ORDER TO MARKET THESE AND OTHER DRUGS MERCK PLANS TO INCREASE ITS SALES FORCE BY FIVE HUNDRED THIS YEAR
SUCH JOBS ARE SEEN AS THE PLUM OF THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF MERCK'S EXTENSIVE LINE OF PRODUCTS
THE PINK SHEET A DRUG INDUSTRY TRADE LETTER REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT MERCK HAD TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND APPLICATIONS FOR THE OPENINGS
I. B. M. FELL ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND THREE EIGHTHS ON MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES
FURMAN SELZ MAGER DIETZ AND BIRNEY REPORTEDLY JOINED THE CROWD OF WALL STREET HOUSES CUTTING THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN I. B. M. EARNINGS ESTIMATE
THE FIRM SAID IT DOESN'T COMMENT ON ITS STOCK RECOMMENDATIONS OR EARNINGS ESTIMATES
TRADERS INSIST THAT AN EXPECTED INJECTION OF LIQUIDITY FROM INVESTMENT TRUSTS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WILL HELP BOOST SHARE PRICES LATER IN THE WEEK
FURTHER SLIDES ON WALL STREET ON THE OTHER HAND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT TRADERS SAY
SOME INVESTORS ARE PREPARING FOR A SHORT TERM CORRECTION THIS MONTH ALTHOUGH MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WON'T BE SIGNIFICANT
THE ARTICLE ALSO STATES USUALLY COMPANIES MUST KEEP PAYING WORKERS PARTICIPATING IN A SLOWDOWN BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOBS AND ADHERE TO THE RULES
HOWEVER AS SUGGESTED LATER IN THE ARTICLE THE EMPLOYER MAY RESPOND WITH A LOCKOUT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF PAY
ONLY A FEW STATES REQUIRE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION FOR LOCKED OUT WORKERS
FOR SUCH GROUP RATE COVERAGE EMPLOYERS CAN CHARGE THE FORMER WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE AVERAGE COST OF PROVIDING THE HEALTH BENEFITS PLUS A TWO PERCENT ADMINISTRATIVE FEE
IN MOST CASES THAT STILL WOULD BE LESS THAN THEY WOULD PAY FOR ARRANGING COVERAGE ON THEIR OWN
BUT SOME MAY BE BETTER OFF LOOKING FOR INSURANCE OUTSIDE THE EMPLOYER'S CONTINUED GROUP RATE PLAN
HOWEVER IN LIGHT OF THE STAKES ALREADY HELD BY THE VARIOUS FACTIONS ONLY ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF GENERALE DE BELGIQUE'S SHARES APPEARED TO BE AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET
THIS MEANS THAT FOR MR. DE BENEDETTI TO INCREASE HIS STAKE BY FIFTEEN PERCENT MEMBERS OF MR. LEYSEN'S GROUP WOULD HAVE TO SELL TO HIM
SOME SOURCES SAID SOME OF THE LESS TRADITIONAL HOLDERS OF GENERALE DE BELGIQUE'S SHARES COULD BE TEMPTED BY THE PROSPECT OF CAPITAL GAINS
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF ANY MEETING WITH GILLETTE CONISTON SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN TO NOMINATE ITS OWN SLATE OF DIRECTORS SOMETIME NEXT WEEK
THE DEADLINE FOR DOING SO IS FEBRUARY TWENTY FIRST TWO MONTHS BEFORE GILLETTE'S APRIL TWENTY FIRST ANNUAL MEETING
THUS IN ORDER TO RESERVE ITS RIGHT TO LAUNCH A PROXY FIGHT CONISTON WOULD NEED TO NOMINATE ITS SLATE BY FRIDAY FEBRUARY NINETEENTH
BIDS TOTALING SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SIX POINT THREE EIGHT FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT FOUR THREE SIX PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE FOR NEXT TUESDAY
IN JANUARY THE ARABIC SPEAKING MIDEAST EXPERT MR. MARTIROSOV ARRIVED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE DELEGATION
HIS CREDENTIALS SUGGESTED THAT THE SOVIETS MIGHT HARBOR MORE INTEREST IN DIPLOMACY THAN REAL ESTATE
IF THE SOVIETS DECIDE TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE MISSION THEY NOW HAVE THE RIGHT GUY HERE SAYS THE ISRAELI OFFICIAL
NOW CIBA IS TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS
IT INVITED RESIDENTS TO JOIN A COMMITTEE TO AIR THEIR GRIPES AGAINST THE COMPANY AND DISCUSS SOLUTIONS
THE COMPANY ALSO DONATED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP TO HIRE SPECIALISTS TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED SITES
THE CONSULTANTS NOTICED AN OMISSION IN THE PLANS THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR FEDERAL REGULATORS HAD SPOTTED
CIBA AGREED TO REMEDY THE OVERSIGHT
SEPARATELY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED SAID IT PLACED C. S. X. AND ITS TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDIARIES ON REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE BECAUSE OF C. S. X.'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN
THE RATING CONCERN ALSO PLACED THE SINGLE A TWO SENIOR DEBT RATING OF C. S. X.'S TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION UNIT ON REVIEW WITH DIRECTION UNCERTAIN
ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT IS UNDER REVIEW
BUT LOOK A LITTLE FURTHER THERE ARE WAYS AROUND HIRING FREEZES
IN A LOCAL PLANT THE MANUFACTURING MANAGER NEEDED ANOTHER FOREMAN A SALARIED POSITION BUT THERE WAS A FREEZE ON HIRING SALARIED PERSONNEL
SO AN HOURLY OPERATOR WAS PROMOTED TO FOREMAN BUT MAINTAINED ON THE HOURLY PAYROLL
THE HEAD COUNT A BOGUS MEASURING DEVICE IF EVER THERE WAS ONE REMAINED THE SAME THERE WAS NO INCREASE IN SALARIED PERSONNEL
NOT EVERYONE BUYS THE DEATH OF THE DOLLAR THESIS
WHILE NOT RULING OUT THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY COULD DECLINE OVER TIME MR. LIPSKY OF SALOMON SAYS HE THINKS THE JURY IS STILL OUT
HE ARGUES THAT FRIDAY'S UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES UNDERMINED THE THESIS OF A SHARPLY SLOWING ECONOMY
HE ALSO SAYS THE AUTHORITIES MEAN WHAT THEY SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT STAND ASIDE AND LET CURRENCIES REACH NEW LOWS POST ELECTION
MR. BEESLEY NOW SAYS HE SOUGHT THE ACCOUNTING CHANGES BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOONER OR LATER WE WOULD NEED TAXPAYER MONEY
HE ACKNOWLEDGES DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL OF SPEEDING UP LOSSES BUT DENIES MAKING ANY THREAT
HOWEVER THE OTHER OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZE HIS MESSAGE AS LET US TRY SOME PHONY BALONEY ACCOUNTING OR WE CAN CAUSE CHAOS
MR. SIMMONS COULDN'T IMMEDIATELY BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
BUT HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW LAST WEEK THAT HE COULD RAISE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PRETTY FAST TO PURSUE AN ACQUISITION
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE WILL TRY TO BUY MCDERMOTT
IN RECENT YEARS HE HAS INVESTED IN G. A. F. CORPORATION AND LOUISIANA LAND AND EXPLORATION COMPANY AMONG OTHERS WITHOUT BIDDING TO ACQUIRE THEM
AT HOME THE PERMANENT SECRETARY OF THE MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION HAS REBUKED THE AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL
ANOTHER SPOKESMAN FOR THE MINISTRY HAS REPLIED TO THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIA
AND THE PRESS SECRETARY TO THE MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION HAS RESPONDED TO NUMEROUS CRITICISMS
NOBODY KNOWS HOW THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT WILL REACT
THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND ASK THEM THAT SAYS MR. APPELBAUM WHO ADDS THAT HIS HOME PHONE IS BUGGED
MEANTIME MORE DEPARTURES LOOM AND HE FEARS THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS FADING
HIGHER INTEREST RATES OF COURSE COULD BE OFFSET BY HIGHER INFLATION
THAT'S MORE OR LESS WHAT THE BLUE CHIP ECONOMISTS EXPECT
BUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MR. GREENSPAN ARE LIKELY TO BE WORKING HARD TO KEEP INFLATION DOWN
THE NEW CHAIRMAN KNOWS THAT HIS POLITICAL CONNECTIONS MAKE SOME MARKET PARTICIPANTS SUSPICIOUS THAT HE WILL TRY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY TO HELP G. O. P. CANDIDATES NEXT YEAR
MITCHELL HELD AN ECONOMIST AT SMITH BARNEY HARRIS UPHAM AND COMPANY THINKS MR. GREENSPAN WANTS TO ESTABLISH HIS CREDENTIALS AS AN INFLATION FIGHTER
AS SIGNS OF A STRONGER ECONOMY EMERGE HE ADDS LONG TERM RATES ARE LIKELY TO DRIFT HIGHER
SHORT TERM RATES HE SAYS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN STEADY OR MOVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER
UNDER TERMS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE ITALIAN AGRICULTURAL CONCERN ASSUMED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN SUBORDINATED DEBT AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION
SHAMROCK'S PRETAX PROFIT FROM THE SALE WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
SHAMROCK HAS INTERESTS IN TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS ENERGY SERVICES REAL ESTATE AND VENTURE CAPITAL
IN ANY CASE THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE SMOOTH TRANSITION THESIS
FOR ONE THING CONSUMERS MAY NOT BE QUITE READY TO QUIT SPENDING
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SALES ARE SLOWING DOWN BUT CONSUMER CREDIT SURGED UPWARD IN DECEMBER
IF IT ISN'T ONE THING IT'S ANOTHER
I SEE BY THE PAPERS THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COMING BUDGET SURPLUS
THE WORRIES ARE OF TWO KINDS
ONE IS THAT WE WILL HAVE THE SURPLUS BUT SHOULDN'T
THE OTHER IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE SURPLUS BUT WON'T
YET EVEN AT EIGHTY SIX HE IS CONSIDERED THE COUNTRY'S MOST DYNAMIC POLITICAL FIGURE
HE'S THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD SHOW UP IN THE PLAZA AND DRAW A CROWD OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SAYS ONE LATIN DIPLOMAT
MR. EISENMANN THE OPPOSITION BUSINESSMAN SAYS ARNULFO ISN'T THE SOLUTION BUT THERE ISN'T ANY SOLUTION WITHOUT ARNULFO
AT FORTY YEARS OLD MR. WANG IS RELATIVELY YOUNG FOR HIS JOB AND THAT UPSETS COLLEAGUES WHO ARE USED TO A GRADUAL PROMOTION SYSTEM BASED ON SENIORITY
SO MR. WANG TELLS PEOPLE HE IS FIFTY
HIS M. B. A. ALSO IRKS SOME COLLEAGUES WHO ARE CONTEMPTUOUS OF FOREIGN CONCEPTS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT MAKE THEM WORK HARDER
THE COST OF ANIMALS USED IN RESEARCH REPRESENTS ONLY ONE PERCENT TO TWO PERCENT OF TOTAL COSTS
SO INCREASING THE COST OF ANIMALS WOULD NOT AFFECT THE BILL FOR ANIMAL RESEARCH SIGNIFICANTLY
HOWEVER INCREASING THE COST OF RESEARCH ANIMALS SHOULD MOTIVATE RESEARCHERS NOT TO WASTE THEM ON MERELY CURIOUS OR REPETITIVE STUDIES
IF SO THEN INCREASING THE COST OF RESEARCH ANIMALS SHOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THE BILL THE PUBLIC PAYS FOR ANIMAL RESEARCH
MCDERMOTT AND N. L. ARE IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE OIL SERVICES BUSINESS
N. L. SERVICES WELLS ONCE THEY ARE DRILLED WHILE MCDERMOTT BUILDS OFFSHORE DRILLING RIGS
BUT BOTH COMPANIES SHOULD BENEFIT FROM AN UPTURN IN THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS BUSINESS
THRIFT NET WORTH
ASSETS MINUS LIABILITIES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIABILITIES
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WAS FOUR POINT SIX THREE PERCENT IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
THRIFTS MUST MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF NET WORTH THAT IS AT LEAST THREE PERCENT OF THEIR LIABILITIES
NEW FEDERAL RULES REQUIRE THRIFTS TO GRADUALLY RAISE THAT LEVEL DEPENDING ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY
THE PROBLEM IS THAT PAN AM'S UNIONS HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN MR. ACKER AND CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT THEY WON'T MAKE CONCESSIONS UNLESS HE IS REPLACED
PAN AM IS CLEARLY BANKING ON GETTING THOSE CONCESSIONS THIS YEAR AN EXECUTIVE AT ANOTHER AIRLINE SAYS
BUT ACKER'S CREDIBILITY HAS ERODED TO THE POINT THAT IF THEY PAN AM DIRECTORS DON'T GET RID OF ACKER THEY WON'T GET THOSE CONCESSIONS
THE WORKING PAPER'S OPTIONS FOR TAXING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INCLUDED LIMITING THE EXCLUSION OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE AND CAFETERIA PLAN BENEFITS
ALSO MENTIONED WAS A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL TO DENY THE DEDUCTION FOR TWENTY PERCENT OF CORPORATE ADVERTISING COSTS AND TO REQUIRE INSTEAD THAT THEY BE AMORTIZED OVER TWO YEARS
IT HAS SOME APPEAL BECAUSE IT WOULD RAISE THIRTY SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS
WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING THAT LEADS TO REAL DEMOCRACY SAYS JAIME BONILLA VICE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE INDEPENDENT LIBERAL PARTY
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN NOTHING BUT STUNTS
AND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH A LOT MORE OF THESE PUBLICITY MANEUVERS WITHOUT GIVING UP MUCH REAL GROUND
NAKASONE SELECTED NOBORU TAKESHITA TO SUCCEED HIM AS JAPAN'S PREMIER
THE CHOICE BY NAKASONE CAME AFTER THE FORMER FINANCE MINISTER AND HIS TWO RIVALS WERE DEADLOCKED OVER WHO SHOULD BE NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
BECAUSE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONTROLS THE PARLIAMENT THE WINNER OF THE TOP PARTY POST ALSO BECOMES PRIME MINISTER
ALTHOUGH JAPAN'S POLICIES WON'T CHANGE RADICALLY UNDER TAKESHITA SIXTY THREE HIS LACK OF FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE COULD WORSEN JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
THE RECALL EXPANDS ON A WITHDRAWAL OF OTHER MODELS BEGUN EARLIER THIS WEEK
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION SAID THREE M. DECIDED TO RECALL ADDITIONAL MODELS OF ITS AIR IONIZERS AFTER RADIATION LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED AT FOUR FACILITIES USING THOSE MODELS
THE EXPANDED RECALL WAS DISCLOSED AT A MEETING WITH N. R. C. OFFICIALS AT AN AGENCY OFFICE OUTSIDE CHICAGO
MARKET ACTION WAS ESSENTIALLY DIGESTING WEDNESDAY'S RALLY
THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX OF FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT STOCKS CLOSED AT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR POINT SIX FIVE DOWN ZERO POINT ONE SIX
BUT SCORES OF SMALLER STOCKS ROSE AND SEVERAL OF THE BIGGER NATIONAL MARKET SYSTEM ISSUES MANAGED GAINS AS WELL BECAUSE OF A KIND WORD FROM AN ANALYST
